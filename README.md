# FocusQuest

A gamified task management app built with React + TypeScript. Transform your to-dos into epic quests, earn XP, level up, and conquer productivity with a stunning dark UI.

## 🎮 What This Is

**FocusQuest** is a modern productivity app that makes task management actually fun. Built with the latest React 19, it combines sleek design with RPG-style progression mechanics. Every completed task earns you XP, helping you level up as you conquer your daily quests.

The entire app is themed with the gorgeous **Catppuccin Mocha** color palette, featuring frosted glassmorphism effects and subtle animated gradients. Auth0 handles secure authentication, so you can focus on what matters — getting things done.

## 🎮 Gamification Mechanics

### XP Calculation
```typescript
Base XP (Difficulty):
- Easy: 10 XP
- Medium: 25 XP
- Hard: 50 XP

Priority Multipliers:
- Low: 1x
- Medium: 1.2x
- High: 1.5x

Final XP = Base XP × Priority Multiplier
```

**Examples:**
- Easy + Low = 10 XP
- Medium + Medium = 30 XP (25 × 1.2)
- Hard + High = 75 XP (50 × 1.5)

### Leveling System
```typescript
XP Required for Level N = 100 × N^1.5

Level 1 → Level 2: 100 XP
Level 2 → Level 3: 283 XP
Level 3 → Level 4: 520 XP
Level 5 → Level 6: 1,118 XP
Level 10 → Level 11: 3,162 XP
```

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **Auth0 Account** (free tier works)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sys-Redux/FocusQuest-gamified-productivity.git
cd FocusQuest-gamified-productivity

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Auth0 Configuration

1. Create an Auth0 Application (Single Page Application)
2. Configure the following settings:
   - **Allowed Callback URLs**: `http://localhost:5173/callback, http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
   - **Allowed Logout URLs**: `http://localhost:5173`
   - **Allowed Web Origins**: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Enable Auth0 Database Connection for email/password registration
4. (Optional) Enable Google Social Connection
5. Request scopes: `openid profile email`
6. Update `src/context/Auth0ProviderWithNavigate.tsx` with your Auth0 credentials:
   ```tsx
   const domain = 'YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN';
   const clientId = 'YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID';
   ```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Catppuccin Mocha Palette
Every color in FocusQuest comes from the carefully curated Catppuccin Mocha theme:
- **Primary**: Mauve (#cba6f7) - Main brand color
- **Accent**: Pink (#f5c2e7), Blue (#89b4fa), Lavender (#b4befe)
- **Semantic**: Green (success), Yellow (warning), Red (danger)
- **Base**: Dark backgrounds (#1e1e2e, #181825, #11111b)
- **Surface**: Layered surfaces (#313244, #45475a, #585b70)
- **Text**: High contrast text (#cdd6f4, #a6adc8, #bac2de)

### Glassmorphism
```css
.glass → Semi-transparent with backdrop-blur-xl
.glass-strong → More opaque with backdrop-blur-2xl
.glass-nav → Scroll-aware navbar with dynamic opacity
```

### Animated Gradients
```css
.gradient-bg → Subtle 300s rotating gradient
.gradient-bg-vibrant → Multi-color vibrant gradient for hero sections
```

---

## 🗺️ Routing Structure

```tsx
/ → HomePage (landing page, shows NavBar if authenticated)
/login → Login page (redirects to /dashboard if authenticated)
/dashboard → Dashboard (protected, requires Auth0 authentication)
/callback → Auth0 callback handler
```

### Provider Hierarchy
```tsx
BrowserRouter
  └── Auth0Provider
      └── UserProgressProvider
          └── TaskProvider
              └── Routes
```

---

## 💾 State Management

### TaskProvider
Manages all task CRUD operations and awards XP on completion:
- `addTask(task: Task)` - Add new task
- `updateTask(id: string, task: Partial<Task>)` - Update existing task
- `deleteTask(id: string)` - Remove task
- `toggleTaskComplete(id: string)` - Toggle completion & award XP (once per task)

### UserProgressProvider
Manages user level and XP progression:
- `addXP(amount: number)` - Add XP and recalculate level
- `resetProgress()` - Reset to level 1 with 0 XP
- Persists to `localStorage` as `focusquest_user_progress`

### Data Persistence
- **Tasks**: Stored in `localStorage` as `focusquest_tasks` (currently disabled, in-memory only)
- **User Progress**: Stored in `localStorage` as `focusquest_user_progress`
- **Auth Session**: Managed by Auth0 with refresh tokens in `localStorage`

---

## 🎯 Key Components

### XPBar
Displays current level, XP progress, and total XP:
- Circular level badge with gradient background
- Animated progress bar with shimmer effect
- XP needed for next level indicator
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### TaskModal
Comprehensive task management modal:
- **View Mode**: Display all task details, completion toggle
- **Edit Mode**: Inline form for editing title, description, priority, difficulty, due date
- **Delete Confirmation**: Overlay dialog to prevent accidental deletions
- Uses single `formData` object with `handleChange` for clean state management

### NavBar
Fixed, scroll-aware navigation:
- Glass effect intensifies on scroll
- Logo with gradient text effect
- Home button (only when authenticated)
- Profile modal trigger with user avatar
- Login/Logout buttons based on auth state

- [ ] **Task Search & Filters** - Find quests by keyword, date, or status
- [ ] **Leaderboards** - Compare XP and levels with other users
- [ ] **Achievements/Badges** - Unlock rewards for milestones
- [ ] **Dark/Light Theme Toggle** - (jk, dark mode forever 😎)
- [ ] **Pomodoro Timer** - Integrate time tracking with tasks
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard** - Productivity trends and insights

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- **Tailwind v4 `@theme`** - Way cleaner than config files, CSS custom properties are the future
- **Fast Refresh** - Keep component and non-component exports in separate files
- **Auth0 Scopes** - Must explicitly request `openid profile email` in authorizationParams
- **Context Separation** - Split context definition, provider, and hook into 3 files for better HMR
- **Fixed Navbars** - Always add top padding (`pt-20`) to main content to compensate for navbar height
- **localStorage** - Perfect for MVPs, but useEffect timing matters for hydration
- **XP Anti-farming** - Track `xpAwarded` boolean on tasks to prevent repeated XP gains
- **Event Propagation** - Use `stopPropagation()` on nested clickable elements (checkbox inside clickable card)
- **Single State Object** - `formData` with `handleChange` cleaner than multiple `useState` calls

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Tasks currently in-memory only (refresh loses data) - localStorage persistence commented out in TaskProvider
- Profile picture may not show if Auth0 social connection doesn't include picture scope
- Animated gradient is very subtle (300s duration) - might not be noticeable on all screens
